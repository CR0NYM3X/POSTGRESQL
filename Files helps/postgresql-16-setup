[postgres@server_test bin]$ postgresql-16-setup       --help

Usage: /usr/bin/postgresql-16-setup {initdb|check_upgrade|upgrade} [SERVICE_NAME]

Script is aimed to help sysadmin with basic database cluster administration.

The SERVICE_NAME is used for selection of proper unit configuration file; For
more info and howto/when use this script please look at README.rpm-dist file.
The 'postgresql' string is used when no SERVICE_NAME is explicitly passed.

Available operation mode:
  initdb        Create a new PostgreSQL database cluster.  This is usually the
                first action you perform after PostgreSQL server installation.
  check_upgrade Checks whether the old cluster can be upgraded to the new version
                or not.
  upgrade       Upgrade PostgreSQL database cluster to be usable with new
                server.  Use this if you upgraded your PostgreSQL server to
                newer major version (currently from 15 to 16).

Environment:
  PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS     Options carried by this variable are passed to
                             subsequent call of `initdb` binary (see man
                             initdb(1)).  This variable is used also during
                             'upgrade' mode because the new cluster is actually
                             re-initialized from the old one.
  PGSETUP_PGUPGRADE_OPTIONS  Options in this variable are passed next to the
                             subsequent call of `pg_upgrade`.  For more info
                             about possible options please look at man
                             pg_upgrade(1).
  PGSETUP_DEBUG              Set to '1' if you want to see debugging output.

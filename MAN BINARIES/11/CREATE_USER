DESCRIPTION
       CREATE USER is now an alias for CREATE ROLE (CREATE_ROLE(7)). The only difference is that when the command is spelled CREATE USER,
       LOGIN is assumed by default, whereas NOLOGIN is assumed when the command is spelled CREATE ROLE.

COMPATIBILITY
       The CREATE USER statement is a PostgreSQL extension. The SQL standard leaves the definition of users to the implementation.

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER ROUTINE changes the definition of a routine, which can be an aggregate function, a normal function, or a procedure. See under
       ALTER AGGREGATE (ALTER_AGGREGATE(7)), ALTER FUNCTION (ALTER_FUNCTION(7)), and ALTER PROCEDURE (ALTER_PROCEDURE(7)) for the description
       of the parameters, more examples, and further details.

EXAMPLES
       To rename the routine foo for type integer to foobar:

           ALTER ROUTINE foo(integer) RENAME TO foobar;

       This command will work independent of whether foo is an aggregate, function, or procedure.

COMPATIBILITY
       This statement is partially compatible with the ALTER ROUTINE statement in the SQL standard. See under ALTER FUNCTION
       (ALTER_FUNCTION(7)) and ALTER PROCEDURE (ALTER_PROCEDURE(7)) for more details. Allowing routine names to refer to aggregate functions
       is a PostgreSQL extension.

SEE ALSO
       ALTER AGGREGATE (ALTER_AGGREGATE(7)), ALTER FUNCTION (ALTER_FUNCTION(7)), ALTER PROCEDURE (ALTER_PROCEDURE(7)), DROP ROUTINE
       (DROP_ROUTINE(7))

       Note that there is no CREATE ROUTINE command.

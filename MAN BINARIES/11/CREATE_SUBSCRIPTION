CREATE SUBSCRIPTION(7)                                  PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                  CREATE SUBSCRIPTION(7)

NAME
       CREATE_SUBSCRIPTION - define a new subscription

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE SUBSCRIPTION subscription_name
           CONNECTION 'conninfo'
           PUBLICATION publication_name [, ...]
           [ WITH ( subscription_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE SUBSCRIPTION adds a new subscription for the current database. The subscription name must be distinct from the name of any
       existing subscription in the database.

       The subscription represents a replication connection to the publisher. As such this command does not only add definitions in the local
       catalogs but also creates a replication slot on the publisher.

       A logical replication worker will be started to replicate data for the new subscription at the commit of the transaction where this
       command is run.

       Additional information about subscriptions and logical replication as a whole is available at Section 31.2 and Chapter 31.

PARAMETERS
       subscription_name
           The name of the new subscription.

       CONNECTION 'conninfo'
           The connection string to the publisher. For details see Section 34.1.1.

       PUBLICATION publication_name
           Names of the publications on the publisher to subscribe to.

       WITH ( subscription_parameter [= value] [, ... ] )
           This clause specifies optional parameters for a subscription. The following parameters are supported:

           copy_data (boolean)
               Specifies whether the existing data in the publications that are being subscribed to should be copied once the replication
               starts. The default is true.

           create_slot (boolean)
               Specifies whether the command should create the replication slot on the publisher. The default is true.

           enabled (boolean)
               Specifies whether the subscription should be actively replicating, or whether it should be just setup but not started yet. The
               default is true.

           slot_name (string)
               Name of the replication slot to use. The default behavior is to use the name of the subscription for the slot name.

               When slot_name is set to NONE, there will be no replication slot associated with the subscription. This can be used if the
               replication slot will be created later manually. Such subscriptions must also have both enabled and create_slot set to false.

           synchronous_commit (enum)
               The value of this parameter overrides the synchronous_commit setting. The default value is off.

               It is safe to use off for logical replication: If the subscriber loses transactions because of missing synchronization, the
               data will be sent again from the publisher.

               A different setting might be appropriate when doing synchronous logical replication. The logical replication workers report the
               positions of writes and flushes to the publisher, and when using synchronous replication, the publisher will wait for the
               actual flush. This means that setting synchronous_commit for the subscriber to off when the subscription is used for
               synchronous replication might increase the latency for COMMIT on the publisher. In this scenario, it can be advantageous to set
               synchronous_commit to local or higher.

           connect (boolean)
               Specifies whether the CREATE SUBSCRIPTION should connect to the publisher at all. Setting this to false will change default
               values of enabled, create_slot and copy_data to false.

               It is not allowed to combine connect set to false and enabled, create_slot, or copy_data set to true.

               Since no connection is made when this option is set to false, the tables are not subscribed, and so after you enable the
               subscription nothing will be replicated. It is required to run ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION in order for tables
               to be subscribed.

NOTES
       See Section 31.7 for details on how to configure access control between the subscription and the publication instance.

       When creating a replication slot (the default behavior), CREATE SUBSCRIPTION cannot be executed inside a transaction block.

       Creating a subscription that connects to the same database cluster (for example, to replicate between databases in the same cluster or
       to replicate within the same database) will only succeed if the replication slot is not created as part of the same command. Otherwise,
       the CREATE SUBSCRIPTION call will hang. To make this work, create the replication slot separately (using the function
       pg_create_logical_replication_slot with the plugin name pgoutput) and create the subscription using the parameter create_slot = false.
       This is an implementation restriction that might be lifted in a future release.

EXAMPLES
       Create a subscription to a remote server that replicates tables in the publications mypublication and insert_only and starts
       replicating immediately on commit:

           CREATE SUBSCRIPTION mysub
                    CONNECTION 'host=192.168.1.50 port=5432 user=foo dbname=foodb'
                   PUBLICATION mypublication, insert_only;

       Create a subscription to a remote server that replicates tables in the insert_only publication and does not start replicating until
       enabled at a later time.

           CREATE SUBSCRIPTION mysub
                    CONNECTION 'host=192.168.1.50 port=5432 user=foo dbname=foodb'
                   PUBLICATION insert_only
                          WITH (enabled = false);

COMPATIBILITY
       CREATE SUBSCRIPTION is a PostgreSQL extension.

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW(7)                             PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                             CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW(7)

NAME
       CREATE_MATERIALIZED_VIEW - define a new materialized view

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name
           [ (column_name [, ...] ) ]
           [ WITH ( storage_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]
           [ TABLESPACE tablespace_name ]
           AS query
           [ WITH [ NO ] DATA ]

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW defines a materialized view of a query. The query is executed and used to populate the view at the time the
       command is issued (unless WITH NO DATA is used) and may be refreshed later using REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW.

       CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW is similar to CREATE TABLE AS, except that it also remembers the query used to initialize the view, so that it
       can be refreshed later upon demand. A materialized view has many of the same properties as a table, but there is no support for
       temporary materialized views or automatic generation of OIDs.

PARAMETERS
       IF NOT EXISTS
           Do not throw an error if a materialized view with the same name already exists. A notice is issued in this case. Note that there is
           no guarantee that the existing materialized view is anything like the one that would have been created.

       table_name
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the materialized view to be created.

       column_name
           The name of a column in the new materialized view. If column names are not provided, they are taken from the output column names of
           the query.

       WITH ( storage_parameter [= value] [, ... ] )
           This clause specifies optional storage parameters for the new materialized view; see Storage Parameters for more information. All
           parameters supported for CREATE TABLE are also supported for CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW with the exception of OIDS. See CREATE TABLE
           (CREATE_TABLE(7)) for more information.

       TABLESPACE tablespace_name
           The tablespace_name is the name of the tablespace in which the new materialized view is to be created. If not specified,
           default_tablespace is consulted.

       query
           A SELECT(7), TABLE, or VALUES(7) command. This query will run within a security-restricted operation; in particular, calls to
           functions that themselves create temporary tables will fail.

       WITH [ NO ] DATA
           This clause specifies whether or not the materialized view should be populated at creation time. If not, the materialized view will
           be flagged as unscannable and cannot be queried until REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW is used.

COMPATIBILITY
       CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW is a PostgreSQL extension.

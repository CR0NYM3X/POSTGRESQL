NAME
       ALTER_PUBLICATION - change the definition of a publication

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER PUBLICATION name ADD TABLE [ ONLY ] table_name [ * ] [, ...]
       ALTER PUBLICATION name SET TABLE [ ONLY ] table_name [ * ] [, ...]
       ALTER PUBLICATION name DROP TABLE [ ONLY ] table_name [ * ] [, ...]
       ALTER PUBLICATION name SET ( publication_parameter [= value] [, ... ] )
       ALTER PUBLICATION name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
       ALTER PUBLICATION name RENAME TO new_name

DESCRIPTION
       The command ALTER PUBLICATION can change the attributes of a publication.

       The first three variants change which tables are part of the publication. The SET TABLE clause will replace the list of tables in the
       publication with the specified one. The ADD TABLE and DROP TABLE clauses will add and remove one or more tables from the publication.
       Note that adding tables to a publication that is already subscribed to will require a ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION action
       on the subscribing side in order to become effective.

       The fourth variant of this command listed in the synopsis can change all of the publication properties specified in CREATE PUBLICATION
       (CREATE_PUBLICATION(7)). Properties not mentioned in the command retain their previous settings.

       The remaining variants change the owner and the name of the publication.

       You must own the publication to use ALTER PUBLICATION. Adding a table to a publication additionally requires owning that table. To
       alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role. The new owner must have CREATE privilege on the
       database. Also, the new owner of a FOR ALL TABLES publication must be a superuser. However, a superuser can change the ownership of a
       publication regardless of these restrictions.

PARAMETERS
       name
           The name of an existing publication whose definition is to be altered.

       table_name
           Name of an existing table. If ONLY is specified before the table name, only that table is affected. If ONLY is not specified, the
           table and all its descendant tables (if any) are affected. Optionally, * can be specified after the table name to explicitly
           indicate that descendant tables are included.

       SET ( publication_parameter [= value] [, ... ] )
           This clause alters publication parameters originally set by CREATE PUBLICATION (CREATE_PUBLICATION(7)). See there for more
           information.

       new_owner
           The user name of the new owner of the publication.

       new_name
           The new name for the publication.

EXAMPLES
       Change the publication to publish only deletes and updates:

           ALTER PUBLICATION noinsert SET (publish = 'update, delete');

       Add some tables to the publication:

           ALTER PUBLICATION mypublication ADD TABLE users, departments;

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER PUBLICATION is a PostgreSQL extension.

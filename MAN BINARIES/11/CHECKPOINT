CHECKPOINT(7)                                           PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                           CHECKPOINT(7)

NAME
       CHECKPOINT - force a write-ahead log checkpoint

SYNOPSIS
       CHECKPOINT

DESCRIPTION
       A checkpoint is a point in the write-ahead log sequence at which all data files have been updated to reflect the information in the
       log. All data files will be flushed to disk. Refer to Section 30.4 for more details about what happens during a checkpoint.

       The CHECKPOINT command forces an immediate checkpoint when the command is issued, without waiting for a regular checkpoint scheduled by
       the system (controlled by the settings in Section 19.5.2).  CHECKPOINT is not intended for use during normal operation.

       If executed during recovery, the CHECKPOINT command will force a restartpoint (see Section 30.4) rather than writing a new checkpoint.

       Only superusers can call CHECKPOINT.

COMPATIBILITY
       The CHECKPOINT command is a PostgreSQL language extension.

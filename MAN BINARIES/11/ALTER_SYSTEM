ALTER SYSTEM(7)                                         PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                         ALTER SYSTEM(7)

NAME
       ALTER_SYSTEM - change a server configuration parameter

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER SYSTEM SET configuration_parameter { TO | = } { value [, ...] | DEFAULT }

       ALTER SYSTEM RESET configuration_parameter
       ALTER SYSTEM RESET ALL

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER SYSTEM is used for changing server configuration parameters across the entire database cluster. It can be more convenient than
       the traditional method of manually editing the postgresql.conf file.  ALTER SYSTEM writes the given parameter setting to the
       postgresql.auto.conf file, which is read in addition to postgresql.conf. Setting a parameter to DEFAULT, or using the RESET variant,
       removes that configuration entry from the postgresql.auto.conf file. Use RESET ALL to remove all such configuration entries.

       Values set with ALTER SYSTEM will be effective after the next server configuration reload, or after the next server restart in the case
       of parameters that can only be changed at server start. A server configuration reload can be commanded by calling the SQL function
       pg_reload_conf(), running pg_ctl reload, or sending a SIGHUP signal to the main server process.

       Only superusers can use ALTER SYSTEM. Also, since this command acts directly on the file system and cannot be rolled back, it is not
       allowed inside a transaction block or function.

PARAMETERS
       configuration_parameter
           Name of a settable configuration parameter. Available parameters are documented in Chapter 19.

       value
           New value of the parameter. Values can be specified as string constants, identifiers, numbers, or comma-separated lists of these,
           as appropriate for the particular parameter. Values that are neither numbers nor valid identifiers must be quoted.  DEFAULT can be
           written to specify removing the parameter and its value from postgresql.auto.conf.

           For some list-accepting parameters, quoted values will produce double-quoted output to preserve whitespace and commas; for others,
           double-quotes must be used inside single-quoted strings to get this effect.

NOTES
       This command can't be used to set data_directory, nor parameters that are not allowed in postgresql.conf (e.g., preset options).

       See Section 19.1 for other ways to set the parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Set the wal_level:

           ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = replica;

       Undo that, restoring whatever setting was effective in postgresql.conf:

           ALTER SYSTEM RESET wal_level;

COMPATIBILITY
       The ALTER SYSTEM statement is a PostgreSQL extension.

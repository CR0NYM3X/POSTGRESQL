ALTER POLICY(7)                                         PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                         ALTER POLICY(7)

NAME
       ALTER_POLICY - change the definition of a row level security policy

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER POLICY name ON table_name RENAME TO new_name

       ALTER POLICY name ON table_name
           [ TO { role_name | PUBLIC | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER } [, ...] ]
           [ USING ( using_expression ) ]
           [ WITH CHECK ( check_expression ) ]

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER POLICY changes the definition of an existing row-level security policy. Note that ALTER POLICY only allows the set of roles to
       which the policy applies and the USING and WITH CHECK expressions to be modified. To change other properties of a policy, such as the
       command to which it applies or whether it is permissive or restrictive, the policy must be dropped and recreated.

       To use ALTER POLICY, you must own the table that the policy applies to.

       In the second form of ALTER POLICY, the role list, using_expression, and check_expression are replaced independently if specified. When
       one of those clauses is omitted, the corresponding part of the policy is unchanged.

PARAMETERS
       name
           The name of an existing policy to alter.

       table_name
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table that the policy is on.

       new_name
           The new name for the policy.

       role_name
           The role(s) to which the policy applies. Multiple roles can be specified at one time. To apply the policy to all roles, use PUBLIC.

       using_expression
           The USING expression for the policy. See CREATE POLICY (CREATE_POLICY(7)) for details.

       check_expression
           The WITH CHECK expression for the policy. See CREATE POLICY (CREATE_POLICY(7)) for details.

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER POLICY is a PostgreSQL extension.

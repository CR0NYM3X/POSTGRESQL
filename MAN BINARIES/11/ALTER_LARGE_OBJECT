ALTER LARGE OBJECT(7)                                   PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                   ALTER LARGE OBJECT(7)

NAME
       ALTER_LARGE_OBJECT - change the definition of a large object

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER LARGE OBJECT large_object_oid OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER LARGE OBJECT changes the definition of a large object.

       You must own the large object to use ALTER LARGE OBJECT. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new
       owning role. (However, a superuser can alter any large object anyway.) Currently, the only functionality is to assign a new owner, so
       both restrictions always apply.

PARAMETERS
       large_object_oid
           OID of the large object to be altered

       new_owner
           The new owner of the large object

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER LARGE OBJECT statement in the SQL standard.

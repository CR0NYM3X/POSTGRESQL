ALTER SERVER(7)                                         PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                         ALTER SERVER(7)

NAME
       ALTER_SERVER - change the definition of a foreign server

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER SERVER name [ VERSION 'new_version' ]
           [ OPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] option ['value'] [, ... ] ) ]
       ALTER SERVER name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
       ALTER SERVER name RENAME TO new_name

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER SERVER changes the definition of a foreign server. The first form changes the server version string or the generic options of the
       server (at least one clause is required). The second form changes the owner of the server.

       To alter the server you must be the owner of the server. Additionally to alter the owner, you must own the server and also be a direct
       or indirect member of the new owning role, and you must have USAGE privilege on the server's foreign-data wrapper. (Note that
       superusers satisfy all these criteria automatically.)

PARAMETERS
       name
           The name of an existing server.

       new_version
           New server version.

       OPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] option ['value'] [, ... ] )
           Change options for the server.  ADD, SET, and DROP specify the action to be performed.  ADD is assumed if no operation is
           explicitly specified. Option names must be unique; names and values are also validated using the server's foreign-data wrapper
           library.

       new_owner
           The user name of the new owner of the foreign server.

       new_name
           The new name for the foreign server.

EXAMPLES
       Alter server foo, add connection options:

           ALTER SERVER foo OPTIONS (host 'foo', dbname 'foodb');

       Alter server foo, change version, change host option:

           ALTER SERVER foo VERSION '8.4' OPTIONS (SET host 'baz');

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER SERVER conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED). The OWNER TO and RENAME forms are PostgreSQL extensions.

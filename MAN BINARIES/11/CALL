CALL(7)                                                 PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                                 CALL(7)

NAME
       CALL - invoke a procedure

SYNOPSIS
       CALL name ( [ argument ] [, ...] )

DESCRIPTION
       CALL executes a procedure.

       If the procedure has any output parameters, then a result row will be returned, containing the values of those parameters.

PARAMETERS
       name
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the procedure.

       argument
           An input argument for the procedure call. See Section 4.3 for the full details on function and procedure call syntax, including use
           of named parameters.

NOTES
       The user must have EXECUTE privilege on the procedure in order to be allowed to invoke it.

       To call a function (not a procedure), use SELECT instead.

       If CALL is executed in a transaction block, then the called procedure cannot execute transaction control statements. Transaction
       control statements are only allowed if CALL is executed in its own transaction.

       PL/pgSQL handles output parameters in CALL commands differently; see Section 43.6.3.

EXAMPLES
           CALL do_db_maintenance();

COMPATIBILITY
       CALL conforms to the SQL standard.

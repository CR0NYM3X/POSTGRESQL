ALTER SUBSCRIPTION(7)                                   PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                   ALTER SUBSCRIPTION(7)

NAME
       ALTER_SUBSCRIPTION - change the definition of a subscription

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION name CONNECTION 'conninfo'
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION name SET PUBLICATION publication_name [, ...] [ WITH ( set_publication_option [= value] [, ... ] ) ]
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION name REFRESH PUBLICATION [ WITH ( refresh_option [= value] [, ... ] ) ]
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION name ENABLE
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION name DISABLE
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION name SET ( subscription_parameter [= value] [, ... ] )
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION name RENAME TO new_name

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION can change most of the subscription properties that can be specified in CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
       (CREATE_SUBSCRIPTION(7)).

       You must own the subscription to use ALTER SUBSCRIPTION. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new
       owning role. The new owner has to be a superuser. (Currently, all subscription owners must be superusers, so the owner checks will be
       bypassed in practice. But this might change in the future.)

PARAMETERS
       name
           The name of a subscription whose properties are to be altered.

       CONNECTION 'conninfo'
           This clause alters the connection property originally set by CREATE SUBSCRIPTION (CREATE_SUBSCRIPTION(7)). See there for more
           information.

       SET PUBLICATION publication_name
           Changes list of subscribed publications. See CREATE SUBSCRIPTION (CREATE_SUBSCRIPTION(7)) for more information. By default this
           command will also act like REFRESH PUBLICATION.

           set_publication_option specifies additional options for this operation. The supported options are:

           refresh (boolean)
               When false, the command will not try to refresh table information.  REFRESH PUBLICATION should then be executed separately. The
               default is true.

           Additionally, refresh options as described under REFRESH PUBLICATION may be specified.

       REFRESH PUBLICATION
           Fetch missing table information from publisher. This will start replication of tables that were added to the subscribed-to
           publications since the last invocation of REFRESH PUBLICATION or since CREATE SUBSCRIPTION.

           refresh_option specifies additional options for the refresh operation. The supported options are:

           copy_data (boolean)
               Specifies whether the existing data in the publications that are being subscribed to should be copied once the replication
               starts. The default is true. (Previously subscribed tables are not copied.)

       ENABLE
           Enables the previously disabled subscription, starting the logical replication worker at the end of transaction.

       DISABLE
           Disables the running subscription, stopping the logical replication worker at the end of transaction.

       SET ( subscription_parameter [= value] [, ... ] )
           This clause alters parameters originally set by CREATE SUBSCRIPTION (CREATE_SUBSCRIPTION(7)). See there for more information. The
           allowed options are slot_name and synchronous_commit

       new_owner
           The user name of the new owner of the subscription.

       new_name
           The new name for the subscription.

EXAMPLES
       Change the publication subscribed by a subscription to insert_only:

           ALTER SUBSCRIPTION mysub SET PUBLICATION insert_only;

       Disable (stop) the subscription:

           ALTER SUBSCRIPTION mysub DISABLE;

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER SUBSCRIPTION is a PostgreSQL extension.

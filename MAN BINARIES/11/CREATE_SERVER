CREATE SERVER(7)                                        PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                        CREATE SERVER(7)

NAME
       CREATE_SERVER - define a new foreign server

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE SERVER [ IF NOT EXISTS ] server_name [ TYPE 'server_type' ] [ VERSION 'server_version' ]
           FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER fdw_name
           [ OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] ) ]

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE SERVER defines a new foreign server. The user who defines the server becomes its owner.

       A foreign server typically encapsulates connection information that a foreign-data wrapper uses to access an external data resource.
       Additional user-specific connection information may be specified by means of user mappings.

       The server name must be unique within the database.

       Creating a server requires USAGE privilege on the foreign-data wrapper being used.

PARAMETERS
       IF NOT EXISTS
           Do not throw an error if a server with the same name already exists. A notice is issued in this case. Note that there is no
           guarantee that the existing server is anything like the one that would have been created.

       server_name
           The name of the foreign server to be created.

       server_type
           Optional server type, potentially useful to foreign-data wrappers.

       server_version
           Optional server version, potentially useful to foreign-data wrappers.

       fdw_name
           The name of the foreign-data wrapper that manages the server.

       OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] )
           This clause specifies the options for the server. The options typically define the connection details of the server, but the actual
           names and values are dependent on the server's foreign-data wrapper.

NOTES
       When using the dblink module, a foreign server's name can be used as an argument of the dblink_connect(3) function to indicate the
       connection parameters. It is necessary to have the USAGE privilege on the foreign server to be able to use it in this way.

       If the foreign server supports sort pushdown, it is necessary for it to have the same sort ordering as the local server.

EXAMPLES
       Create a server myserver that uses the foreign-data wrapper postgres_fdw:

           CREATE SERVER myserver FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (host 'foo', dbname 'foodb', port '5432');

       See postgres_fdw for more details.

COMPATIBILITY
       CREATE SERVER conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED).

CREATE ACCESS METHOD(7)                                 PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                 CREATE ACCESS METHOD(7)

NAME
       CREATE_ACCESS_METHOD - define a new access method

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE ACCESS METHOD name
           TYPE access_method_type
           HANDLER handler_function

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE ACCESS METHOD creates a new access method.

       The access method name must be unique within the database.

       Only superusers can define new access methods.

PARAMETERS
       name
           The name of the access method to be created.

       access_method_type
           This clause specifies the type of access method to define. Only INDEX is supported at present.

       handler_function
           handler_function is the name (possibly schema-qualified) of a previously registered function that represents the access method. The
           handler function must be declared to take a single argument of type internal, and its return type depends on the type of access
           method; for INDEX access methods, it must be index_am_handler. The C-level API that the handler function must implement varies
           depending on the type of access method. The index access method API is described in Chapter 61.

EXAMPLES
       Create an index access method heptree with handler function heptree_handler:

           CREATE ACCESS METHOD heptree TYPE INDEX HANDLER heptree_handler;

COMPATIBILITY
       CREATE ACCESS METHOD is a PostgreSQL extension.

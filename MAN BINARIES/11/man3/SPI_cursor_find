SPI_CURSOR_FIND(3)                                      PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                      SPI_CURSOR_FIND(3)

NAME
       SPI_cursor_find - find an existing cursor by name

SYNOPSIS
       Portal SPI_cursor_find(const char * name)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_cursor_find finds an existing portal by name. This is primarily useful to resolve a cursor name returned as text by some other
       function.

ARGUMENTS
       const char * name
           name of the portal

RETURN VALUE
       pointer to the portal with the specified name, or NULL if none was found

NOTES
       Beware that this function can return a Portal object that does not have cursor-like properties; for example it might not return tuples.
       If you simply pass the Portal pointer to other SPI functions, they can defend themselves against such cases, but caution is appropriate
       when directly inspecting the Portal.

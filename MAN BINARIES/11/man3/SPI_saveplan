SPI_SAVEPLAN(3)                                         PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                         SPI_SAVEPLAN(3)

NAME
       SPI_saveplan - save a prepared statement

SYNOPSIS
       SPIPlanPtr SPI_saveplan(SPIPlanPtr plan)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_saveplan copies a passed statement (prepared by SPI_prepare) into memory that will not be freed by SPI_finish nor by the
       transaction manager, and returns a pointer to the copied statement. This gives you the ability to reuse prepared statements in the
       subsequent invocations of your C function in the current session.

ARGUMENTS
       SPIPlanPtr plan
           the prepared statement to be saved

RETURN VALUE
       Pointer to the copied statement; or NULL if unsuccessful. On error, SPI_result is set thus:

       SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT
           if plan is NULL or invalid

       SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED
           if called from an unconnected C function

NOTES
       The originally passed-in statement is not freed, so you might wish to do SPI_freeplan on it to avoid leaking memory until SPI_finish.

       In most cases, SPI_keepplan is preferred to this function, since it accomplishes largely the same result without needing to physically
       copy the prepared statement's data structures.

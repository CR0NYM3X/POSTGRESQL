SPI_FINISH(3)                                           PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                           SPI_FINISH(3)

NAME
       SPI_finish - disconnect a C function from the SPI manager

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_finish(void)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_finish closes an existing connection to the SPI manager. You must call this function after completing the SPI operations needed
       during your C function's current invocation. You do not need to worry about making this happen, however, if you abort the transaction
       via elog(ERROR). In that case SPI will clean itself up automatically.

RETURN VALUE
       SPI_OK_FINISH
           if properly disconnected

       SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED
           if called from an unconnected C function

NAME
       SPI_execute_with_args - execute a command with out-of-line parameters

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_execute_with_args(const char *command,
                                 int nargs, Oid *argtypes,
                                 Datum *values, const char *nulls,
                                 bool read_only, long count)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_execute_with_args executes a command that might include references to externally supplied parameters. The command text refers to a
       parameter as $n, and the call specifies data types and values for each such symbol.  read_only and count have the same interpretation
       as in SPI_execute.

       The main advantage of this routine compared to SPI_execute is that data values can be inserted into the command without tedious
       quoting/escaping, and thus with much less risk of SQL-injection attacks.

       Similar results can be achieved with SPI_prepare followed by SPI_execute_plan; however, when using this function the query plan is
       always customized to the specific parameter values provided. For one-time query execution, this function should be preferred. If the
       same command is to be executed with many different parameters, either method might be faster, depending on the cost of re-planning
       versus the benefit of custom plans.

ARGUMENTS
       const char * command
           command string

       int nargs
           number of input parameters ($1, $2, etc.)

       Oid * argtypes
           an array of length nargs, containing the OIDs of the data types of the parameters

       Datum * values
           an array of length nargs, containing the actual parameter values

       const char * nulls
           an array of length nargs, describing which parameters are null

           If nulls is NULL then SPI_execute_with_args assumes that no parameters are null. Otherwise, each entry of the nulls array should be
           ' ' if the corresponding parameter value is non-null, or 'n' if the corresponding parameter value is null. (In the latter case, the
           actual value in the corresponding values entry doesn't matter.) Note that nulls is not a text string, just an array: it does not
           need a '\0' terminator.

       bool read_only
           true for read-only execution

       long count
           maximum number of rows to return, or 0 for no limit

RETURN VALUE
       The return value is the same as for SPI_execute.

       SPI_processed and SPI_tuptable are set as in SPI_execute if successful.

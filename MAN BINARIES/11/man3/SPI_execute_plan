SPI_EXECUTE_PLAN(3)                                     PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                     SPI_EXECUTE_PLAN(3)

NAME
       SPI_execute_plan - execute a statement prepared by SPI_prepare

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_execute_plan(SPIPlanPtr plan, Datum * values, const char * nulls,
                            bool read_only, long count)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_execute_plan executes a statement prepared by SPI_prepare or one of its siblings.  read_only and count have the same interpretation
       as in SPI_execute.

ARGUMENTS
       SPIPlanPtr plan
           prepared statement (returned by SPI_prepare)

       Datum * values
           An array of actual parameter values. Must have same length as the statement's number of arguments.

       const char * nulls
           An array describing which parameters are null. Must have same length as the statement's number of arguments.

           If nulls is NULL then SPI_execute_plan assumes that no parameters are null. Otherwise, each entry of the nulls array should be ' '
           if the corresponding parameter value is non-null, or 'n' if the corresponding parameter value is null. (In the latter case, the
           actual value in the corresponding values entry doesn't matter.) Note that nulls is not a text string, just an array: it does not
           need a '\0' terminator.

       bool read_only
           true for read-only execution

       long count
           maximum number of rows to return, or 0 for no limit

RETURN VALUE
       The return value is the same as for SPI_execute, with the following additional possible error (negative) results:

       SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT
           if plan is NULL or invalid, or count is less than 0

       SPI_ERROR_PARAM
           if values is NULL and plan was prepared with some parameters

       SPI_processed and SPI_tuptable are set as in SPI_execute if successful.

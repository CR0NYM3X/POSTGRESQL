SPI_KEEPPLAN(3)                                         PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                         SPI_KEEPPLAN(3)

NAME
       SPI_keepplan - save a prepared statement

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_keepplan(SPIPlanPtr plan)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_keepplan saves a passed statement (prepared by SPI_prepare) so that it will not be freed by SPI_finish nor by the transaction
       manager. This gives you the ability to reuse prepared statements in the subsequent invocations of your C function in the current
       session.

ARGUMENTS
       SPIPlanPtr plan
           the prepared statement to be saved

RETURN VALUE
       0 on success; SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT if plan is NULL or invalid

NOTES
       The passed-in statement is relocated to permanent storage by means of pointer adjustment (no data copying is required). If you later
       wish to delete it, use SPI_freeplan on it.

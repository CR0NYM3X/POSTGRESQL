NAME
       SPI_register_trigger_data - make ephemeral trigger data available in SPI queries

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_register_trigger_data(TriggerData *tdata)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_register_trigger_data makes any ephemeral relations captured by a trigger available to queries planned and executed through the
       current SPI connection. Currently, this means the transition tables captured by an AFTER trigger defined with a REFERENCING OLD/NEW
       TABLE AS ... clause. This function should be called by a PL trigger handler function after connecting.

ARGUMENTS
       TriggerData *tdata
           the TriggerData object passed to a trigger handler function as fcinfo->context

RETURN VALUE
       If the execution of the command was successful then the following (nonnegative) value will be returned:

       SPI_OK_TD_REGISTER
           if the captured trigger data (if any) has been successfully registered

       On error, one of the following negative values is returned:

       SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT
           if tdata is NULL

       SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED
           if called from an unconnected C function

       SPI_ERROR_REL_DUPLICATE
           if the name of any trigger data transient relation is already registered for this connection

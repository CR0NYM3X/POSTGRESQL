NAME
       SPI_connect, SPI_connect_ext - connect a C function to the SPI manager

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_connect(void)

       int SPI_connect_ext(int options)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_connect opens a connection from a C function invocation to the SPI manager. You must call this function if you want to execute
       commands through SPI. Some utility SPI functions can be called from unconnected C functions.

       SPI_connect_ext does the same but has an argument that allows passing option flags. Currently, the following option values are
       available:

       SPI_OPT_NONATOMIC
           Sets the SPI connection to be nonatomic, which means that transaction control calls (SPI_commit, SPI_rollback) are allowed.
           Otherwise, calling those functions will result in an immediate error.

       SPI_connect() is equivalent to SPI_connect_ext(0).

RETURN VALUE
       SPI_OK_CONNECT
           on success

       SPI_ERROR_CONNECT
           on error

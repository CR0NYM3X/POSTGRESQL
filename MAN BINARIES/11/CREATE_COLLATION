CREATE COLLATION(7)                                     PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                     CREATE COLLATION(7)

NAME
       CREATE_COLLATION - define a new collation

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE COLLATION [ IF NOT EXISTS ] name (
           [ LOCALE = locale, ]
           [ LC_COLLATE = lc_collate, ]
           [ LC_CTYPE = lc_ctype, ]
           [ PROVIDER = provider, ]
           [ VERSION = version ]
       )
       CREATE COLLATION [ IF NOT EXISTS ] name FROM existing_collation

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE COLLATION defines a new collation using the specified operating system locale settings, or by copying an existing collation.

       To be able to create a collation, you must have CREATE privilege on the destination schema.

PARAMETERS
       IF NOT EXISTS
           Do not throw an error if a collation with the same name already exists. A notice is issued in this case. Note that there is no
           guarantee that the existing collation is anything like the one that would have been created.

       name
           The name of the collation. The collation name can be schema-qualified. If it is not, the collation is defined in the current
           schema. The collation name must be unique within that schema. (The system catalogs can contain collations with the same name for
           other encodings, but these are ignored if the database encoding does not match.)

       locale
           This is a shortcut for setting LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE at once. If you specify this, you cannot specify either of those parameters.

       lc_collate
           Use the specified operating system locale for the LC_COLLATE locale category.

       lc_ctype
           Use the specified operating system locale for the LC_CTYPE locale category.

       provider
           Specifies the provider to use for locale services associated with this collation. Possible values are: icu, libc.  libc is the
           default. The available choices depend on the operating system and build options.

       version
           Specifies the version string to store with the collation. Normally, this should be omitted, which will cause the version to be
           computed from the actual version of the collation as provided by the operating system. This option is intended to be used by
           pg_upgrade for copying the version from an existing installation.

           See also ALTER COLLATION (ALTER_COLLATION(7)) for how to handle collation version mismatches.

       existing_collation
           The name of an existing collation to copy. The new collation will have the same properties as the existing one, but it will be an
           independent object.

NOTES
       Use DROP COLLATION to remove user-defined collations.

       See Section 23.2.2.3 for more information on how to create collations.

       When using the libc collation provider, the locale must be applicable to the current database encoding. See CREATE DATABASE
       (CREATE_DATABASE(7)) for the precise rules.

EXAMPLES
       To create a collation from the operating system locale fr_FR.utf8 (assuming the current database encoding is UTF8):

           CREATE COLLATION french (locale = 'fr_FR.utf8');

       To create a collation using the ICU provider using German phone book sort order:

           CREATE COLLATION german_phonebook (provider = icu, locale = 'de-u-co-phonebk');

       To create a collation from an existing collation:

           CREATE COLLATION german FROM "de_DE";

       This can be convenient to be able to use operating-system-independent collation names in applications.

COMPATIBILITY
       There is a CREATE COLLATION statement in the SQL standard, but it is limited to copying an existing collation. The syntax to create a
       new collation is a PostgreSQL extension.

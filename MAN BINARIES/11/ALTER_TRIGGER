ALTER TRIGGER(7)                                        PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                        ALTER TRIGGER(7)

NAME
       ALTER_TRIGGER - change the definition of a trigger

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER TRIGGER name ON table_name RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER TRIGGER name ON table_name DEPENDS ON EXTENSION extension_name

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER TRIGGER changes properties of an existing trigger. The RENAME clause changes the name of the given trigger without otherwise
       changing the trigger definition. The DEPENDS ON EXTENSION clause marks the trigger as dependent on an extension, such that if the
       extension is dropped, the trigger will automatically be dropped as well.

       You must own the table on which the trigger acts to be allowed to change its properties.

PARAMETERS
       name
           The name of an existing trigger to alter.

       table_name
           The name of the table on which this trigger acts.

       new_name
           The new name for the trigger.

       extension_name
           The name of the extension that the trigger is to depend on.

NOTES
       The ability to temporarily enable or disable a trigger is provided by ALTER TABLE (ALTER_TABLE(7)), not by ALTER TRIGGER, because ALTER
       TRIGGER has no convenient way to express the option of enabling or disabling all of a table's triggers at once.

EXAMPLES
       To rename an existing trigger:

           ALTER TRIGGER emp_stamp ON emp RENAME TO emp_track_chgs;

       To mark a trigger as being dependent on an extension:

           ALTER TRIGGER emp_stamp ON emp DEPENDS ON EXTENSION emplib;

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER TRIGGER is a PostgreSQL extension of the SQL standard.

COMMIT PREPARED(7)                                      PostgreSQL 11.22 Documentation                                      COMMIT PREPARED(7)

NAME
       COMMIT_PREPARED - commit a transaction that was earlier prepared for two-phase commit

SYNOPSIS
       COMMIT PREPARED transaction_id

DESCRIPTION
       COMMIT PREPARED commits a transaction that is in prepared state.

PARAMETERS
       transaction_id
           The transaction identifier of the transaction that is to be committed.

NOTES
       To commit a prepared transaction, you must be either the same user that executed the transaction originally, or a superuser. But you do
       not have to be in the same session that executed the transaction.

       This command cannot be executed inside a transaction block. The prepared transaction is committed immediately.

       All currently available prepared transactions are listed in the pg_prepared_xacts system view.

EXAMPLES
       Commit the transaction identified by the transaction identifier foobar:

           COMMIT PREPARED 'foobar';

COMPATIBILITY
       COMMIT PREPARED is a PostgreSQL extension. It is intended for use by external transaction management systems, some of which are covered
       by standards (such as X/Open XA), but the SQL side of those systems is not standardized.
